# My Auto Hotkey

This is my hotkey settings on Windows.

The script will be executed by `autohotkey`. ( [https://autohotkey.com/](https://autohotkey.com/) )

### hotkeys

- `CapsLock` works as `ESC`.

  > I don't use `CapsLock` to compose other hotkeys, because if I do that, it will delay the speed of performing as `ESC`.

- `Ctrl` + `Win` + `h` can switch to left desktop. (vim-style)

- `Ctrl` + `Win` + `l` can switch to right desktop. (vim-style)

- `Ctrl` + `Win` + `x` can delete the current desktop. (vim-style)
